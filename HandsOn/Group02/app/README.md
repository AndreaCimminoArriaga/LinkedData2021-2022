## Steps to execute the app:

In order to use the app, the following files should be downloaded from the "app" folder:

1. App.py
2. output-with-links.ttl

Both files must be in the same folder.

Our app has a similar functionality of a calculator, a menu with different types of searches will appear and the user chooses one of the options.
Once the App.py is executed in Python, a message will appear as “Seleccione un tipo de búsqueda”, where the user must choose one of the options given writing only it’s number.
